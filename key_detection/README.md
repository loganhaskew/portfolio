# Key Determination Using Machine Learning and Spectral Data

This projects aims to explore the use of machine learning in determining what key a song or musical piece is recorded in. This is an elementary implementation, but does provide a good look at how this could be implemented at a larger scale.

This was a fun one, but ultimately ended with lackluster results due to issues obtaining enough good data to train models effectively. 

### Running the Code

If you'd like to try running the code, follow along the key_detection notebook. This will explain when the Python scripts are necessary and how to download the data I used. I'll also include some of the spectral information I gathered from the clips used in the csv files in this repository. There are two clips used in the concept exploration housed in the concept_data repository.
