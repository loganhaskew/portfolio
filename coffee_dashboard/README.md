# Visualization Dashboard for Coffee Commerce and Consumption

I've been wanting to explore a Python based visualization tool rather than relying on Tableau or some similar solution for every visualization or dashboarding task. 

Here is a simple dashboard built using Bokeh, hvPlot, and Panel that shows data on the economy and business surrounding my personal favorite beverage. The plots are interactive and allow for more detailed exploration without code cells clouding up the workspace.

If you don't have time to run the code (or don't want to install the required packages and libraries), check out the Dashboard_SS.png file to see what it looks like.
