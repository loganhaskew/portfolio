# Welcome to my Personal Project Repository

Here is where I'll store some fun personal projects I'm currently working on or have worked through in the past. 

### A Bit About Myself

I was engineer in industry for a handful of years before moving into more management focused roles. I always found myself taking on analytics and data science projects wherever possible. I'm currently trying to formalize and grow this skillset to move into a more tech-related role. My background is in electrical engineering, but I'm currently completing my master's in data science.

Presently, I travel the US with my  wonderful wife and our three dogs. You can usually find us in some random city scoping out the best local beer and food.

Please take a look around and check out some of my projects!
