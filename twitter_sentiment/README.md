## Twitter Sentiment and Stock Price Correlation
This project is an elementary attempt at exploring the correlation between Twitter sentiment and stock price as an excuse to use different APIs in gathering data. 
It also provides a platform for some basic statistical exploration in Python.

There is a significant limitation in the amount of data that can be pulled at one time for free from Twitter. There are other endpoints that allow for slightly modified analysis that could yield interesting results. These would require minimal changes to the notbook that resides in this repository.
